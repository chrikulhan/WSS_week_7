<!--Functions as arguments to other functions-->

<!--You’ve also used these with event handlers-->
<!--Function definition as argument to other function – a callback-->
<!--When the event happens, the callback function will be called-->
<!--This pattern is very common, to describe what tasks should be performed sometime in the future-->
