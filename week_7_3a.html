<!--API: Application Programming Interface-->
<!--Two meanings:-->

<!--1. a general term for the methods and functions provided by a program or library-->
<!--"JavaScript’s API includes methods like querySelector() and setInterval()"-->
<!--Leaflet API includes methods like marker and bindPopup -->

<!--2. A service provided by a server that other programs can connect to and make
requests over HTTP/HTTPS(browser uses this same language), and receive responses that can be used in a program-->
<!--Responses are often in JSON format, but can be various other types of data (can be plain text, XML, an image, etc.-->
<!--Remember your web browser also makes HTTP requests, and a server responds with
HTML, CSS, images, JS…-->

<!--Many APIs – for example, the World Bank has an API that provides data about countries-->
<!--Income level, GDP, financial information, climate….-->

<!--Try this URL in your browser-->
<!--https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/br?format=json    This is a request for information about Brazil-->
<!--Change br – the country code for Brazil - to the country code of your choice – for example, try ch for Switzerland
or in for India or zw for Zimbabwe or us for the USA-->
<!--https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes-->

<!--Fetching data from an API-->
<!--Request data, expect a response-->

<!--One of two things may happen: -->
<!--  1. Request may error
          a. if not understood by the server (ex. URL is incorrect)
          b. Not allowed to request data (permissions error)
          c. no internet connection
          d. etc.
          -->
<!--  2. Or, a response can be received (probably JSON), which must be processed before use-->
<!--      a. processing step might work, (and then there will be data (including a variable with a response) -->
<!--      b. another error might happen
              **might be expecting JSON data and get plain text back
              **might get an image
              **might get a media file
              **etc. -->

<!--This might work, data is now available to code-->
<!--or an error may be encountered (example: expected JSON data, received an image)-->

<!--With callbacks, you’d need to write something like this-->

<!--That’s a lot of parenthesis – it’s messy and hard to keep track of what’s happening-->

<!--Don’t write this code, it won’t work-->

<!--We'll see another way to write this logic soon-->

<!--Lab Project - Capital City Quiz-->
<!--Website that displays a random country, user guesses the capital city
Page will use a list of countries
You will use the World Bank API to fetch a country’s capital city, by country code
-->

<!--Another API – Where is the International Space Station?-->
