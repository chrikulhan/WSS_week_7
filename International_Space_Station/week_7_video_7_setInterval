**Problem with setInterval**

-A time diagram with setInterval

-What happens if the fetch() takes a long time?
Perhaps longer than the interval?

**Another way to arrange the call to the ISS function:
-Use a recursive setTimeout
    *function is called
    *when the function ends, we will wait another 10 seconds
    after that function is done before making another function
    call.
