      //setTimeout works in all browsers

    //  setTime 2nd argument: 2nd is
    alert("Hello! This happened 3 seconds after the page loaded.")
  }, 3000) //3000 is the delay before the function is called.
//  Delay specified in milliseconds, 1000th of a second (3000 milliseconds = 3 seconds)
//  ALL the interactivity and javascript is paused on the page.

  // **Examples of slow tasks**
//      Fetching data from a database
//      Fetching data from an API
//      Processing data returned from a database call or API call
//      Loading an image from a file
//      Image processing
//      Saving a file
//      Deliberately waiting for a period of time

//  Example from when writing on a picture, needed to pause the
//  writing portion until the picture was loaded.
//
//  Other javascript tasks can happen while the photo is loading.
